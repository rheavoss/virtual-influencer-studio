# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable GitHub issues using vertical slices (tracer bullets).

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a GitHub issue number or URL as an argument, fetch it with `gh issue view <number>` (with comments).

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses

Ask: Does granularity feel right? Are dependency relationships correct? Should any slices be merged or split?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Create the GitHub issues

For each approved slice, create a GitHub issue using `gh issue create` in dependency order (blockers first).

<issue-template>
## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Blocked by

- Blocked by #<issue-number> (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.
